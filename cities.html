            Thank you to all of our speakers, thought leaders, participants and facilitators for making the ThinkTank a very special day of converging disciplines, extraordinary creativity and interesting conversations. The format fostered many strong ideas around future opportunity spaces for our cities.

        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>According to the United Nations over 50% of the world’s population is living in cities today. Projections indicate
          that this number will increase dramatically in the future. As a result, cities are facing challenges and strains
          related to housing, transportation, infrastructure, climate change, employment, energy, safety, education and health
          care.</p>

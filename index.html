            Thank you to all of our speakers, thought leaders, participants and facilitators for making the ThinkTank a very special day of converging disciplines, extraordinary creativity and interesting conversations. The format fostered many strong ideas around future opportunity spaces for our cities. For initial impressions of the day, please see our gallery <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1619484424809403.1073741899.271444199613439&type=1&l=9777971515&mc_cid=0c8c77ace4&mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D">here</a>. If you would like to share this with colleagues within or outside your disciplines, who would enjoy being pushed out of their comfort zone and co-creating ideas around large scale topics, please share their information as well here. Thank you again for playing such an important role and we look forward to hearing from you and seeing you at future events.

        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>According to the United Nations over 50% of the world’s population is living in cities today. Projections indicate
          that this number will increase dramatically in the future. As a result, cities are facing challenges and strains
          related to housing, transportation, infrastructure, climate change, employment, energy, safety, education and health
          care.</p>

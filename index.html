        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>According to the United Nations over 50% of the world’s population is living in cities today. Projections indicate that this number will increase dramatically in the future. As a result, cities are facing challenges and strains related to housing, transportation, infrastructure, climate change, employment, energy, safety, education and health care.</p>

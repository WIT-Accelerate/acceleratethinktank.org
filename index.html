        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>According to the United Nations over 50% of the world’s population is living in cities today. Projections indicate that this number will increase dramatically in the future. As a result, cities are facing challenges and strains related to housing, transportation, infrastructure, climate change, employment, energy, safety, education and health care.</p>

        <h3>THINK TANK - PREPARE TO BE INSPIRED</h3>
        <p>For one day, the ThinkTank brings together 50+ students and faculty from local universities, industry thought leaders across different disciplines, design thinkers, community partners, and city representatives. We will challenge our assumptions, explore possibilities, co-create ideas and inspirations to envision the “Future of Our Cities” for all generations.</p>
        <p>We are excited at the opportunity this event represents to build stronger collaborations and partnerships between the academic community and industry and to convene innovative minds to develop future scenarios to give more insights across disciplines and sectors.</p>
        <p>The ideas coming out of this event will be shared on various platforms and have the potential to engage, inspire, and activate real initiatives.</p>
